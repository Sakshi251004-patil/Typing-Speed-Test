<h2> WHAT IS TOUCH TYPING?</h2>
<h4 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">Touch typing is the ability to type using all your fingers, without looking at the keyboard. This a valuable skill for employers because it enables employees to produce and edit text at a much faster speed than usual. It also means that finished work has a greater level of accuracy. For employees, it means a better work experience, and more time available for other tasks. Touch typing skills are beneficial in almost all industries, especially with continued technological advances. There are individual benefits to touch typing, too. First of all, touch typing makes working at a computer more comfortable. Second, it enhances communication between colleagues and customers. Third, it improves the accuracy of documents. From a productivity standpoint, an individual's typing speed increases when switching from two finger typing to touch typing. With two-finger or slow typing, at 20 words per minute (wpm) they will type a 600 word document in half an hour. A trained typist, averaging 70 wpm, will take 8.5 minutes to type this same document. Thus, the individual saves a considerable amount of time. With time saved up, over the long term, this also helps the company save significant amounts of money. The average typing speed in the UK is reported to be around 50 words per minute. So, learning to touch type is a great way to boost your employability and stand out from the crowd in the job market. Pitman Training offers excellent, qualified typing courses - for beginners to typists that want to advance.</h5></br>
<h4 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">Let's take a look at some of the benefits of touch typing. Plus, we show you how you can learn how to type, and some of the roles which require touch typing skills from potential job candidates.</h5>

<h2>6 Benefits of touch typing skills</h2>
<h3>1. Save time</h3>
<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>Perhaps the most obvious benefit of learning to touch type is that it saves an individual (and their company) considerable amounts of time. An average two finger typist, with a speed of 10 words per minute, will type a 170-word section in about 17 minutes. A touch typist, on the other hand, typing at an average 60 words per minute, can type the same section in around 4 minutes.</h5>
<h3>2. Better for your overall health</h3>
<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>Touch typing is also better for your overall health. It prevents you from bending over your keyboard as you search for the right keys. Instead, your eyes stay focused on the screen in front of you. Correct typing promotes good posture and prevents neck or back strain.</h5>
<h3>3. Decrease fatigue</h3>
<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>Typing is exhausting for both the brain and the body when you have to do it for long periods of time. Touch typing reduces this mental and physical fatigue because it enables you to focus purely on the content you want to type, rather than the typing itself. woman using touch typing</h5>
<h3>4. Increased speed of text production</h3>
<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>A skilled typist is able to finish a writing task within a specific length of time and is not hindered by their slower typing speed. Hence, candidates who learn to type faster are more favourable to employers. It guarantees that they can produce more text for the company (and in less time).</h5>
<h3>5. Accuracy</h3>
<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>Touch typing improves the accuracy of the work a typist produces. This is because they are extremely familiar with the location of all the letters on the keyboard. Thus, there are fewer mistakes, and mistakes are much more quickly corrected. It also increases employees' confidence in their work and is important to a company's productivity.</h5>
<h3>6. Increases workplace productivity</h3>
<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>The combined effect of all the individual benefits of typing quickly is that overall workplace productivity is dramatically boosted. Employees have more energy, are able to produce higher-quality work at a faster pace, and make fewer errors. They also enjoy more time for other projects, and have improved communication.</h5>

<h2>Learn How to Type</h2>
<h4 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h4>Typing skills are invaluable in many workplaces, and working to improve your typing speed is a worthwhile venture. So, maybe you want to learn to type faster or start from the basics. Here are a few ways you can begin to learn how to type, or improve your typing skills:</h4>
<h2>1. Correct Hand Position</h2>
<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>The first key to learning to type is learning the correct hand position. Starting with your pinky on the A key, Your left-hand fingers rest on the A, S, D, and F keys. The right-hand pinky goes on the ; key, and fingers rest on the J, K, L, and ; keys. These keys are the home row keys. Your thumbs should either be in the air or lightly touch the spacebar key.</h5>
<h2>2. Practice typing without looking at fingers</h2>
<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>Once you have the hand positions down, you can practice touch typing - typing without looking at the keyboard. By doing so, your muscles will memorise the movements and even key patterns. For example, when you type frequently used combinations such as “the”, your motor system will pick up on this. With muscle memory, you can type at a much faster speed. In addition, when you type looking at the screen, you are able to catch errors faster. learning to type faster</h5>
<h2>3. Aim for Accuracy, Not Speed</h2>
<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>You might be tempted to speed up your typing no matter what the cost. But actually, it pays to take your time. Rushing can cause you to make many mistakes and sacrifice accuracy. Plus, if you have to go back to edit all of the mistakes you made, this will cost you even more time. Instead, focus on getting the words typed correctly. With time, your speed will improve.</h5>

<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);"></h5>In a quality typing course, you will learn all of these techniques and more. This is one of the best things you can do to improve your typing speed. A course will teach you the correct hand placement, how to type without looking at the keyboard, and give you a strong foundation. Courses will also give you much needed practice, which is key to learning anything. This will allow you to improve much needed typing skills.</h5>

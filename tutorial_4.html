<h1 style="color:#ffbf80;">Do you want to improve your typing speed?</h1>
<h2 style="color:black;">Just like most skills, it all comes down to practice. With every lesson you complete, you create muscle memory in all of your fingers. While practicing using all 10 fingers in the right positions to hit the keys, you can train your fingers to remember it on their own.
Working on this for just 15 minutes a day, after the first couple of weeks, you’ll know the exact location of every key without even looking down at the keyboard. But remember, the key is in learning the RIGHT way. Without learning the correct positions, you’ll just be wasting your time. You might even slow yourself down in the long run. Or if you’re ready to stop talking and start doing, you can jump right into our typing lessons where we take you through the whole process.</h2>
